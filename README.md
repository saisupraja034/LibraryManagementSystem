# LibraryManagementSystem
This is a simple Library Management System built using Core Java and key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It is designed to help beginners understand how real-world systems (like a library) can be modeled using classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, and more.

# OOP Concepts Used
Abstraction – Functional logic is hidden behind method calls

Encapsulation – All class data is protected using private fields

Polymorphism – Extended via method calls and future-proof design

Inheritance – Can be applied for Person → User model

# Technologies Used
Java (JDK 8+)
VS code
